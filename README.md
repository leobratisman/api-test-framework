To get started with the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. This file will
store sensitive environment variables such as database credentials and JWT settings.

#### 1. Create a .env File:

In your project root directory, create a file named .env.

```shell
touch .env
```

#### 2. Add the Required Variables:

Copy and paste the following environment variables into the `.env` file:

```shell
APP_HOST="http://localhost:8000"

DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./local.db"

JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
JWT_SECRET_KEY="some_your_secret_key"
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE=1800
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE=5184000
```
